However, if Freddie Mac elects not to draft a payoff transaction for a matured Mortgage, Freddie Mac, in its sole discretion, may exercise its right to require the Servicer to repurchase the Mortgage. The Servicer will be responsible for all accrued interest through the date of payoff and the Servicer will incur a compensatory fee if the funds are not available to Freddie Mac by the applicable Payoff Draft Date. In addition, Freddie Mac reserves the right to assess a delayed draft noncompliance compensatory fee (see Section 8303.42) for all matured Mortgages for which the Servicer fails to report timely. The Servicer will receive an edit if the Servicer attempts to report a principal and interest activity in the next Accounting Cycle following the month of maturity."}

These provisions determine whether or not the ARM is assumable by the party to whom the Mortgaged Premises is transferred, and, if it is assumable, the transferee must agree to assume the Mortgage loan obligation. Some loan instruments provide that the ARM is assumable for the life of the loan. Other loan instruments provide that the ARM is assumable only after the initial fixed-rate period has expired or until a specified event has occurred and is thereafter not assumable. The Servicer must review the loan instruments to determine the assumption provisions for an ARM. Regardless of whether a loan instrument indicates that an ARM is not assumable, the ARM may be assumed as a workout Mortgage assumption or a simultaneous modification and assumption. Servicers must refer to and follow the requirements in Sections 9207.2 through 9207.8 for these assumptions."}

The Borrower's ownership of the home is jeopardized when he or she stops making monthly payments. Freddie Mac is committed to helping Borrowers find a solution to the Delinquency if they are experiencing financial difficulty in making the Mortgage payment. The Borrower must make a commitment to reduce any discretionary, unnecessary expenditures as a condition of Freddie Mac granting a relief or workout option. Additionally, the Borrower is expected to work out similar relief or workout options with other creditors whenever possible. Freddie Mac recognizes that not every Borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty can retain home ownership. When this is the case, the Servicer can help a Borrower understand the benefits of selling the property to avoid the consequences of foreclosure, where applicable, and the risk of a deficiency judgment. Freddie Mac wants the Servicer to pursue alternatives to foreclosure whenever possible, because they benefit not only the Borrower, but also the Servicer, Freddie Mac and other interested parties in the Mortgage by:"}
