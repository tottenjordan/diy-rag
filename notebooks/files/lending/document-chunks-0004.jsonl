These affordable housing programs are often based on State or local inclusionary housing policies, which typically require a specified number or percentage of properties in a designated area to be dedicated as housing individuals and households with very low-, low- or moderate-incomes. These resale restrictions are typically administered by a subsidy provider or program administrator. The income-based resale restrictions restrict the initial sales price and subsequent resale price of properties subject to such restrictions. The resale restricted price provides a form of subsidy to the homebuyer in an amount equal to the difference between the sales price and the market value of the property without resale restrictions. The restrictions must be stated in a separate covenant, restriction, easement, or condition in a deed or other instrument executed by or on behalf of the owner of the land or property and must be recorded against that land or property.

Credit reputation, capacity and collateral are often called the \u201cthree Cs\u201d of underwriting.

Multiple characteristics that increase risk without sufficient offsetting factors are likely to result in excessive risk layering. An offsetting factor does not need to be established for each risk factor if the overall risk is balanced. The Seller's conclusion that a Mortgage has acceptable layering of risk must be documented in the file and at a minimum include: The identified risk factors The identified offsetting factors Documentation of the offsetting factors A written conclusion that the Mortgage does not exhibit excessive layering of risks The Seller must determine that each component (credit reputation, capacity and collateral) is acceptable and that the overall layering of risk is acceptable. A conclusion that the Mortgage is acceptable cannot be reached by looking only at a single underwriting component or by placing the most weight on a single component, but may result from balancing the weakness of one component against the strength of the other"}

For example, a Borrower with weak capacity may be found to be acceptable because of strong collateral and credit reputation, but a Borrower with weak capacity and weak credit reputation is not acceptable because only collateral is strong. Even when each of the three components is acceptable, layered risk may make a Mortgage unacceptable. Characteristics specific to the Mortgage request, such as the type of Mortgage product, the purpose of the Mortgage and the property type securing the Mortgage, add layers of risk that must be considered. For instance: An ARM adds an additional layer of capacity risk to a Mortgage request that would not be present in a fixed-rate Mortgage A cash-out refinance Mortgage adds an additional layer of capacity risk to a Mortgage request that would not be present in a \u201cno cash-out\u201d refinance Mortgage A Mortgage secured by a 2- to 4-unit property or a Condominium Unit adds a layer of collateral risk that would not be present in a Mortgage secured by a 1-unit detached dwelling"}

A FICO Score is an effective tool in evaluating a Borrower's credit reputation; however, it does not necessarily indicate that the Borrower's credit reputation is acceptable. The reason codes indicate the most important reasons why a FICO score is not higher and must be used by the Seller to identify the credit factors that need to be addressed in determining the Borrower has an acceptable credit reputation. Because FICO scores evaluate the information in the Borrower's repository credit file at the time the FICO score was created, a Seller underwriting with FICO scores will find much of the evaluation of the Borrower's credit reputation is already reflected in the FICO score and accompanying reason codes.

However, if several of the Borrower's credit accounts showed late payments, or the Borrower's Mortgage or installment loan were also late, the single late on the charge account ten months ago may be considered significant, so the Seller should obtain a letter of explanation from the Borrower and include it in the Mortgage file. A written explanation is required for significant derogatory information.

FICO scores have different names at each of the three major United States credit reporting companies. All of these scores, however, are developed using the same methods by FICO. FICO scores are known as:\n\n|-|-|\n| Credit Reporting Company | FICO Score |\n| Equifax\u00ae | Equifax FICO Classic v5 |\n| Experian\u00ae | Experian/Fair Isaac Risk Model v2 |\n| TransUnion\u00ae | TransUnion FICO Risk Score 04 |\n\nFreddie Mac has identified a strong correlation between Mortgage performance and FICO Bureau scores (FICO score). FICO scores range from 300 to 850. The lower the FICO score, the greater the risk of default."}

The Seller must request FICO scores and accompanying reason codes from at least two of the credit repositories, for each Borrower. The three credit repositories are: Equifax Credit Information Services \u25a0 Experian Information Systems and Services TransUnion Credit Information Company The following versions of the FICO score are required for Manually Underwritten Mortgages: \u25a0 Equifax FICO Classic v5 Experian/Fair Isaac Risk Model v2 TransUnion FICO Risk Score 04 It is unusual for a Borrower who reports credit obligations on the application not to have a FICO score. If no FICO score is received for such a Borrower, the Seller must re-check the information provided when ordering the FICO scores and resubmit a request if an error is identified. The Seller must obtain FICO scores no more than 120 days prior to, as applicable, the Note Date, the modification date for Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages, the Conversion Date for Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages or assumption agreement date."}

For a FICO score to be usable it must be based on sufficient, accurate information.

This is important both to ensure that the FICO score is adequately indicative of a Borrower's credit reputation and to ensure fairness for Borrowers in using Credit Scores to evaluate their overall credit reputation. Because a merged credit report or Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR) may show more Tradelines than were included in the particular repository's file used to generate the FICO score, the Seller should request that the credit reporting company indicate on the credit report the number of Tradelines that were used to create each FICO score. Alternatively, the Seller may wish to obtain the in-file report used to create each FICO score and use the in-file report to determine if the FICO score was based on at least three Tradelines."}

However, minor discrepancies in the balances owed or payment amounts on open accounts belonging to the Borrower are not to be considered significant.

In addition, the Seller is strongly encouraged to inform the Borrower that, pursuant to rights granted under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Borrower has a right to contact both the consumer reporting agency (repository) from which the inaccurate FICO score was obtained and the furnisher of the inaccurate credit information to require the disputed credit information to be reinvestigated and corrected.

All income must be expected to continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as described in this chapter. The Seller must analyze all income documentation while taking into consideration the characteristics of the employed income (e.g., employment source, income type and stability of the employment history, including any gaps in employment). A Borrower who has had different types of employment in the past may be considered to have stable income if the income amount has remained at a consistent level. When evaluating a Borrower who has frequently changed jobs, the Seller must focus on whether the changes have affected the Borrower's ability to pay their obligations."}

For Borrowers who are active-duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces, a history of military employment is not required for the employment to be considered stable. Tenure with the same employer or in a similar industry lends support to the analysis of employment stability. When a Borrower has less than a two-year history of primary employment, the Seller must provide its justification for determining that the employment is stable, taking into consideration factors such as income and/or employment characteristics and the overall layering of risk factors, including the Borrower's demonstrated ability to repay obligations. Examples that may support less than a two-year history: Example 1: For a Borrower returning to the workforce after a period of extended absence, for any reason, documentation is provided to support a stable employment history that directly preceded the extended absence"}
