To determine the interest due for the month, multiply the outstanding principal balance by the interest rate of the Mortgage and divide by 12.

If applicable law specifically requires a different method, the Servicer must so notify Freddie Mac (see Directory 7) in writing before remitting payments to Freddie Mac. When computations involve multiple installments, such as several delinquent installments, the interest from each may be computed using the same principal balance (Exhibit 63, Interest Calculation: Amortization Method). The amount to be applied to interest from each installment also may be calculated in succession, using the principal balance remaining after the previous calculation and principal application (Exhibit 64, Interest Calculation: Amortization Method). Similarly, a method that strictly applies payments according to a predetermined amortization schedule is also acceptable. For Initial Interests\u2122 Mortgages, the monthly payment will be interest-only followed by fully amortizing principal and interest payments beginning on the First Amortizing Payment Date. For Initial Interest Mortgages, Servicers must have the ability to produce monthly payment statements for Borrowers."}
