Mortgage insurance premium refunds should be refunded directly to Freddie Mac by the MI on the claim for loss. If, however, the MI sends a refund of the mortgage insurance premium to the Servicer directly, the Servicer must credit the MI premium refund on the claim as income when it submits a request for expense reimbursement."}
