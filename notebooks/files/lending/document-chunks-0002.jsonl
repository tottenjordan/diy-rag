In some jurisdictions, leases that predate the mortgage have a superior claim to the mortgage even if they have not been recorded. Normally, a tenant's rights under a pre-existing lease remain intact on the sale of the leased premises. Accordingly, if the lease is not subordinate to the mortgage, the lender must review each lease to ensure that any tenant's rights to purchase the property, and any other rights that could affect adversely the mortgagee's interest, have been waived formally by the tenant or tenants.\n\n## Mortgages Permitting Open-End Advances\n\nFannie Mae will purchase or securitize a government mortgage loan that includes an open-end advance provision only if the provision gives Fannie Mae the option not to make any advances.

Flood insurance coverage is required when a loan is secured by a property located in \u2022 a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), or \u2022 a Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) or Otherwise Protected Area (OPA). The lender and servicer must determine whether the property is located in an SFHA, a CBRS, or an OPA by using the FEMA Standard Flood Hazard Determination form. All flood zones beginning with the letter \"A\" or \"V\" are considered SFHAS. Note: If the subject property is located within a CBRS or an OPA, flood insurance is required regardless of whether the property is located in an SFHA.

Fannie Mae publishes state-specific fixed-rate notes for ten jurisdictions (although they are not available for all products). The multistate note can be used in most jurisdictions unless the security property is located in a jurisdiction for which Fannie Mae publishes a state-specific mortgage note. The various notes that are used for fixed-rate mortgages may be found on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website.

Fannie Mae does not publish state- specific notes for all ARM plans. If Fannie Mae does not publish state-specific documents for a particular ARM plan, the lender must use the multistate note for that particular ARM plan and amend it as necessary to satisfy the requirements of the jurisdiction in which the security property is located. Required amendments may be incorporated by reprinting the amended documents, adding addenda to the documents, or making the changes on the documents themselves. The various notes that are used for ARMs may be found on Fannie Mae's Legal Documents website.

The maximum overdelivery amount is 25% of the original commitment amount. For example, on an original commitment amount of $150,000, the maximum overdelivery amount is an additional $37,500 (25% of $150,000). In this example, the total delivered against the commitment cannot exceed $187,550 ($150,000 + $37,500 + $50).

For example, if the first payment date is November 1, and the issue date of the MBS is January 1, then, in order to be eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae, the November and December payments must have been paid, and the only payment that may be delinquent (due) would be for the period December 2 through January 1.

Lenders participating in a Fannie Majors pool receive an MBS representing its share of the pool in proportion to the dollar amount of mortgages it Published September 4, 2024 992 contributed to the pool.\n\n# Obtaining Fannie Majors Pool Numbers\n\nThe pool number identifies the pools in which a lender's loans are included. Fannie Mae assigns Fannie Majors pool numbers based on loan term, pass-through rate, and the month of issuance. Pool numbers, CUSIP numbers, and pass-through rates are posted on the Fannie Majors page on Fannie Mae's website and on the various wire services."}

To be eligible for a Fannie Majors pool, mortgages may be no older than 11 months as of the security issue date. For example, all loans to be included in a December 2019 pool, must have first payment dates on or after January 2019. As with single-lender, fixed-rate MBS pools, the minimum and maximum allowable interest rate within a Fannie Majors pool is 25 basis points (.25%) and 112.5 basis points (1.125%) respectively above the pool's pass- through rate. Lenders can use loan-level buyups and buydowns to eliminate excess servicing and, in the case of buydowns, include loans in a higher coupon."}

If multiple trades are executed against a single pool transmission, the delivery variance applies to each trade. Lenders that need a higher or lower variance in some situations should contact the Capital Markets Pricing and Sales Desk to negotiate an alternative variance. Lenders should note, however, that trades that have variances outside of SIFMA's tolerances will not be eligible for TBA trades. Also, no variance is allowed for transactions in which the seller provides the buyer with a pool number and specific original face amount on the date the two parties agree to enter into the transaction.

The lender must establish a process for selecting loans for its discretionary post-closing QC selections. The process must take into account the lender's assessment of the risks inherent in its origination processes, business sources and volume, and product mix, and must be reviewed regularly and, when necessary, adjusted to ensure that the sample selected, including sample size, is appropriate.

Fannie Mae uses a statistically valid approach in selecting a random sample of new mortgage loan deliveries for review. The random sample is augmented with targeted, discretionary sampling, which aids in the measurement of the overall quality of loan deliveries. The QC process evaluates loan files on a comprehensive basis with the primary focus of confirming that mortgage loans meet Fannie Mae's underwriting and eligibility requirements.

This information is provided through a variety of methods that range from regular electronic transmissions to more formal periodic discussions. The detailed loan-level reports that lenders receive identify significant defects, findings, and loans with no identified defects. Fannie Mae's quality control process provides lenders with a holistic view of loan quality by identifying loans with significant defects as well as loans that had findings that do not affect the overall eligibility.

Under California law, the term \"settlor\" refers to the individual(s) establishing the trust; therefore, Fannie Mae uses this terminology in the signature forms and in their related instructions. Fannie Mae has also used the term \u201ccredit applicant\" to refer to an individual whose credit is used to qualify for the mortgage. A lender that originates mortgages to inter vivos revocable trusts secured by properties in a state other than California is responsible for making any modifications (including the use of different terminology, if appropriate) needed to conform these signature forms to those that are customary for that state and will be held fully accountable for the use of any invalid signature form(s)."}

For stated-structure ARM MBS pools, it is the difference between the lowest mortgage margin in the pool and the sum of the guaranty fee and the minimum servicing fee. For weighted-average ARM MBS pools, the MBS margin may be a fixed margin that the lender specifies or a weighted-average margin. A \u201cfixed\u201d MBS margin is attained by varying the servicing fee for individual mortgages to equalize the differences in their mortgage margins. A \"weighted-average\" MBS margin is attained by reducing the various mortgage margins by the applicable guaranty fee and a fixed servicing fee that the lender specifies, thus developing a different MBS margin for each mortgage.
