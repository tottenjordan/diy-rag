A typical profit and loss statement has a format similar to IRS Form 1040, Schedule C. A year-to-date profit and loss statement is not required for most businesses, but if the borrower's loan application is dated more than 120 days after the end of the business's tax year, the lender may choose to require this document if it believes that it is needed to support its determination of the stability or continuance of the borrower's income. If the lender did not count the borrower's year-to-date salary or draws in determining the borrower's qualifying income, it may add them to the net profit shown on the profit and loss statement as well as adding any of the allowable adjustments it used in analyzing the tax returns for the business, such as nonrecurring income and expenses, depreciation, and depletion."}

This level of documentation may not be adequate for every borrower and every situation. The lender must determine whether additional documentation is warranted. If the lender is unable to determine the stability of the borrower's income on the basis of the available documentation, the income must be removed and the loan resubmitted to DU. The standards for employment documentation are the same for DU loan casefiles as they are for manually underwritten loans. For example, paystubs, W-2s, and tax returns must meet the same requirements without regard to the underwriting method. The following information describes DU considerations for specific types of income. For additional information, see B1-1-03, Allowable Age of Credit Documents and Federal Income Tax Returns, and Section B3-3.1, Employment and Other Sources of Income. Note: Only actual employer information should be entered in the employment section of the loan Published September 4, 2024 383 \u2714 Fannie Mae application. For example, do not enter \u201cretired\u201d or \u201chomemaker\u201d as the borrower's current employer."}

Borrowers are not required to make a minimum borrower contribution from their own funds for the rental payments to be credited toward the down payment. The rent credit is not considered an interested party contribution. The rent credit from the seller for the down payment is determined by calculating the difference between the market rent and the actual rent paid by the borrower. The market rent is determined by the appraiser in the appraisal for the subject property and the credit may be no more than the difference between the market rent and the actual rent paid.Documentation RequirementsThe lender must obtain the following documentation: \u2022 A copy of the rental/lease with an option to purchase agreement that evidences the following: Published September 4, 2024 429 \u2714 Fannie Mae \u2022 an original term of at least 12 months,"}

While rent-back credit to the borrower paid by the seller is permissible as part of the sale; it cannot be used as an eligible source of funds for closing costs, down payment, or reserves when qualifying the borrower. A rent-back credit may appear on the Closing Disclosure as a credit to the borrower. In all cases, the lender must underwrite the loan without any consideration of the rent-back credit (e.g., it must not be entered in the DU loan application data) and must document that the borrower has sufficient funds for the transaction from eligible sources. Note: For loans secured by the borrower's principal residence, the borrower must continue to meet any occupancy requirements as outlined in the security instrument.

Special or creative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third-party institutional lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction.

For example, if the typical one-unit building site in a particular area (based on the zoning, the highest and best use of the land, and the present land use) is two acres in size, the mortgage will be eligible for purchase or securitization regardless of the percentage of the total appraised value of the property that the site represents, as long as the appraiser demonstrates through the use of comparable sales that the property is a typical residential property for that particular neighborhood."}

However, some factors that are typical of a mixed-use neighborhood, such as easy access to employment centers and a high level of community activity, can actually enhance the market value of the property through increased buyer demand. Neighborhoods may frequently reflect a blend of residential and nonresidential land uses. When different land uses and property types are present in a neighborhood, that fact should be considered a neighborhood characteristic that the appraiser needs to take into consideration when performing the neighborhood analysis and defining the neighborhood boundaries. To confirm that any positive or negative effects of the mixed land uses are reflected in the sales comparison analysis, the appraiser should select comparable sales from within the same neighborhood whenever possible. If this is not possible, the appraiser may need to make neighborhood or location adjustments to the Sales Comparison Approach adjustment grid for any sales that are not subject to the same neighborhood characteristic.

In some situations, sales of properties that are not truly comparable may simply be the best available and the most appropriate for the appraiser's analysis. The use of such sales is acceptable as long as the appraiser adequately documents the analysis and explains why these sales were used. (For additional information, see B4-1.3-03, Neighborhood Section of the Appraisal Report.

They are most often established to provide water or other utilities in areas that are not served by existing city or municipal utility services. The need for these districts arises when an existing utility service does not have sufficient capacity, or may not find it economically feasible to provide services for newly created subdivisions that are located beyond its current operating area. State law governing the establishment of special assessment districts varies greatly, as does the financial strength of the individual districts. These districts are granted the authority to assess owners of properties within their boundaries for funds that will be used to cover their operating costs and debt service.

Proceeds from the special tax are used to support the sale of tax-exempt bonds for the various capital improvements that are allowed under the legislation, including but not limited to, roads, sewer services, schools, police and fire protection services, and libraries. The assessment that will be used to repay the tax-exempt bonds becomes an ongoing responsibility of the property owner, similar to state and local property taxes.

Before delivering a loan secured by an individual unit in a project, the lender must determine that the project meets Fannie Mae's eligibility requirements. Project eligibility risk is a risk that is distinct from the credit risk presented by individual borrowers. Units located in a project present risks that are also distinct from the risks associated with properties that are not part of a homeowners' association (HOA) or project.

Project eligibility and financial strength are key drivers of credit performance on individual unit mortgages and critical to the long-term success of the project.

Lenders that sell mortgage loans secured by units in a condo, co-op, or PUD project to Fannie Mae are expected to have staff that are knowledgeable about and qualified to evaluate the specific risks presented by these types of projects.

Consequently, all states devise their own laws resulting in diverse approaches to manufactured home titling and lien perfection. The variety of approaches is particularly challenging for lenders originating manufactured home loans in more than one state. Laws of some states do not clearly provide for a single lien on the manufactured home, together with the land on which it is situated, but instead, for example, require that the lien on the manufactured home be evidenced by notation on the certificate of title."}

In these states, the lien on the land (evidenced by the mortgage, deed of trust or security deed) may be legally distinct from the lien on the manufactured home (evidenced on the certificate of title), though both are liens on real property. In this instance, the manufactured home is often treated as an \u201cimmovable fixture\u201d (personal property that has become so permanently attached to the land that it has become real property).

When a single-closing transaction is used, the lender will be responsible for managing the disbursement of the loan proceeds to the builder, contractor, or other authorized suppliers. Because the loan documents specify the terms of the permanent financing, the construction loan will automatically convert to a permanent long-term mortgage loan upon completion of the construction. Loans that combine construction and permanent financing into a single transaction cannot be purchased by Fannie Mae until the construction is completed and the terms of the construction loan have converted to the permanent financing. Manufactured homes must meet all applicable requirements, including compliance with B5-2-05, Manufactured Housing Legal Considerations. Lenders must use SFC 151 when delivering single-closing construction-to-permanent loans to Fannie Mae (and any other SFCs that may apply to the transaction)."}
