Any remedies that are applied will, in Fannie Mae's sole judgment, be commensurate with the associated level of risk. Generally, Fannie Mae pursues these remedies when it believes that the lender should have an opportunity to correct the breach of the Lender Contract. Instead of terminating all or a part of the Lender Contract (or the lender's selling arrangement or servicing arrangement) when it has cause to do so, Fannie Mae may elect to pursue a variety of other remedies and/or may impose additional requirements as a condition for not terminating all or a part of the Lender Contract (or the lender's selling arrangement or servicing arrangement). The following list provides some possible requirements that Fannie Mae may impose as a condition for not undertaking remedies to which it is entitled by virtue of a lender's breach: \u2022 requiring the lender to indemnify Fannie Mae for actual and prospective Fannie Mae losses; \u2022 requiring the lender to repurchase a mortgage loan or an acquired property or remit a make whole payment; \u2022 imposing a compensatory fee;"}

Fannie Mae's decision not to take action against a lender at any point in time does not mean that Fannie Mae condones any action or inaction by the lender, or that Fannie Mae is waiving its right to take action in the future.

Prior to imposing any sanction, Fannie Mae will generally give the lender notice of the contemplated action so the lender can submit a written response or request a meeting with its Fannie Mae customer account team. The lender's written response must include a description and explanation of any mitigating circumstances or specific proposals to satisfy Fannie Mae's objections to the lender's performance of its obligations under the Lender Contract. Fannie Mae reserves the right to omit these steps and take immediate action to terminate or suspend the Lender Contract at any time in accordance with the provisions thereof."}

Fannie Mae may apply the suspension of a selling arrangement to all products or to specific products, depending on the type and seriousness of the lender's failure to perform. Even when Fannie Mae suspends a lender's selling arrangement, it will honor any outstanding whole loan commitments and MBS pool purchase contracts.

During the QC reviews, Fannie Mae may identify a \"defect\"-a loan-level deficiency that breaches a term contained in the Lender Contract in effect at the time of loan delivery. These reviews may result in loan repurchase demands, make whole payment demands, or other alternative remedies. Fannie Mae requires some repurchases because the terms under which the mortgages were purchased or securitized call for a repurchase under certain conditions or circumstances. Repurchases that fall into this category generally include, but are not limited to, Charter violations, an adjustable-rate mortgage in an MBS pool that has converted to a fixed-rate mortgage per the borrower's exercise of its option in the mortgage documents, or an MBS mortgage that has 24 payments past due."}

Often fraud for profit schemes involve a pattern: two or more mortgage loans, multiple parties in various roles within the mortgage industry, and no true intent to repay the mortgage. Participants in fraud schemes can include borrowers, originators, appraisers, brokers, real estate agents, closing agents, builders, lenders, and title companies. There are a variety of types of mortgage fraud including: \u2022 undisclosed liabilities, \u2022 misrepresentation of income or employment, \u2022 misrepresentation of credit, \u2022 identity theft and/or Social Security number discrepancy, \u2022 misrepresentation of assets, Published September 4, 2024 125 \u2714 Fannie Mae \u2022 misrepresentation of occupancy, \u2022 misrepresentation of property value, \u2022 property flips based on inflated appraisals or other false characteristics,"}

The limits are subject to change annually and vary, depending upon the number of units in the property and the property's location. The conforming loan limits are posted on Fannie Mae's website.

The non-credit risk factors evaluated by DU include: the borrower's equity and LTV ratio, liquid reserves, loan purpose, loan term, loan amortization type, occupancy type, debt-to-income ratio, housing expense ratio, property type, and variable income. DU performs a comprehensive evaluation of these factors, weighing each factor based on the amount of risk it represents and its importance to the recommendation. DU analyzes the results of this evaluation along with the evaluation of the borrower's credit profile to arrive at the underwriting recommendation for the loan casefile. More information on these risk factors is provided below. Also see below for information about the risk factors DU considers when evaluating loans where no borrower has a credit score."}
{"gse": "fannie", "filename": "fannie_part_0", "file_chunk_id": "c771", "chunk_id": "fannie_part_0_c771", "content": "# B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU (12/13/2023)\n\n## Credit History\n\nPublished September 4, 2024 281 A borrower's credit history is an account of how well the borrower has handled credit, both now and in the past. An older, established history-even though the accounts may have zero balances\u2014will have a more positive impact on the borrower's credit profile than newly established accounts. A borrower who has a relatively new credit history (a few recently opened accounts) is not automatically considered a high credit risk. Successfully managing newly established accounts, including making payments as agreed, signifies lower risk."}
{"gse": "fannie", "filename": "fannie_part_0", "file_chunk_id": "c772", "chunk_id": "fannie_part_0_c772", "content": "# B3-2-03, Risk Factors Evaluated by DU (12/13/2023)\n\n## Delinquent Accounts\n\nPayment history is a significant factor in the evaluation of the borrower's credit. DU considers the severity of the delinquencies (30, 60, 90, or more days late), the length of time since the delinquencies, and the number and type of accounts that were not paid as agreed. A payment history that includes bills that are 30 days or more past-due, or a history of paying bills late as evidenced by a number of accounts with late payments, will have a negative impact on the borrower's credit profile. The amount of time that has elapsed since an account was delinquent is an important factor included in the evaluation of the payment history. For example, a 30-day late payment that is less than three months old indicates a higher risk than a 30-day late payment that occurred several years ago.\n\n## Installment Loans\n\nDU evaluates how well a borrower manages debt for all types of installment loans such as mortgage, auto, unsecured, and student loans. Research has shown that borrowers with no active installment accounts represent a higher risk than borrowers who have active installment accounts."}

When DU logic can identify rent payments in the asset verification report, it will use the rent payment history to positively supplement the credit risk assessment. The following requirements apply when using rent payment history in DU: \u2022 At least one borrower must \u2022 be a first-time homebuyer purchasing a principal residence, \u2022 have a credit score (nontraditional credit is not permitted), and \u2022 have been renting for at least 12 months with a monthly rent payment of at least $300. \u2022 For DU to be able to identify rent payments, the lender must \u2022 enter the monthly rent paid by the borrower in the online loan application, \u2022 obtain an asset verification report with 12 months of bank statement data through an authorized DU validation service asset verification report vendor, and \u2022 confirm the borrower is an account holder and that the account provided in the asset verification report is the one from which the borrower pays rent."}

When an asset verification report is used for both rent history and asset documentation, including asset validation through the DU validation service, only the most recent 60 days of account activity must be reviewed in accordance with the requirements in B3-4.2-02, Depository Accounts and B3-2-02, DU Validation Service, and retained in the loan file. For additional details on record retention, see A2-4.1-01, Establishing Loan Files.\n\n# Revolving Credit Utilization\n\nThe establishment, use, and amount of revolving credit a borrower has available are important. Trended credit data is used to evaluate the borrower's ability to manage revolving accounts. A borrower who uses revolving accounts conservatively, meaning low revolving credit utilization or regular payoff of revolving balance, is considered lower risk. A borrower whose revolving credit utilization is high or who has low available revolving credit is considered higher risk."}
{"gse": "fannie", "filename": "fannie_part_0", "file_chunk_id": "c775", "chunk_id": "fannie_part_0_c775", "content": "# Public Records, Foreclosures, and Collection Accounts\n\nA credit history that includes any significant derogatory credit event is considered high risk. Significant derogatory credit events include bankruptcy filings, foreclosures, deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure, preforeclosure sales, mortgage charge-offs, or accounts that have been turned over to a collection agency. The more recent such events occurred, the more adverse the impact is on the credit profile. Although most public record information is retained in the credit history for seven years (ten years for bankruptcies), as time passes, it does become less significant to DU's credit evaluation. | Note: Collection accounts reported as medical collections are not used in the DU risk assessment.\n\n# Inquiries\n\nDU evaluates inquiries made within the most recent 12 months of the credit report date. Research has shown that a high number of inquiries can indicate a higher degree of risk. However, multiple inquiries made by different mortgage lenders or different auto loan creditors within the same time frame is not viewed by DU as multiple inquiries (these types of inquiries generally reflect borrowers shopping for favorable rates or terms). A borrower who has frequently applied for, or obtained, new or additional credit represents a higher risk."}

Research has shown that a borrower who makes a large down payment or who has considerable equity in their property is less likely to become delinquent on a mortgage loan than a borrower who makes a small down payment or has a small amount of equity in the property. In other words, the more equity a borrower has in the property, the lower the risk associated with the borrower's mortgage loan. Published September 4, 2024 283 \u2714 Fannie Mae DU may use a low LTV ratio to offset other risks that it may identify in the loan application."}
{"gse": "fannie", "filename": "fannie_part_0", "file_chunk_id": "c777", "chunk_id": "fannie_part_0_c777", "content": "# Liquid Reserves\n\nLiquid reserves are those financial assets that are available to a borrower after a loan closes. Reserves are calculated as the total amount of liquid assets remaining after the loan transaction closes divided by the qualifying payment amount. DU considers higher amounts of liquid reserves as more favorable than lower amounts or no reserves. Research has shown that mortgages to borrowers with higher amounts of liquid reserves tend to have lower delinquency rates. As with a low LTV ratio, DU may consider high amounts of reserves as an offset for other risks that it may identify in the loan application.\n\n## Loan Purpose\n\nThere is a certain level of risk associated with every transaction, whether it is a purchase or a refinance. Purchase transactions represent less risk than refinance transactions. When evaluating refinance transactions, a limited cash-out refinance transaction represents less risk than a cash-out refinance transaction.\n\n## Loan Term\n\nResearch has shown that mortgages to borrowers who choose to finance their mortgages over shorter terms and build up equity in their properties faster generally tend to perform better than mortgages with longer amortization periods."}

Fixed-rate mortgages will be viewed as representing less risk than adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\n# Occupancy Type\n\nPerformance statistics on investor loans are notably worse than those of owner-occupied or second home loans. Owner-occupied transactions represent the least risk, followed by second home transactions, and investment property transactions having the highest risk level."}
{"gse": "fannie", "filename": "fannie_part_0", "file_chunk_id": "c779", "chunk_id": "fannie_part_0_c779", "content": "# Debt-to-Income Ratio\n\nIn DU's evaluation, generally, the lower the borrower's debt-to-income ratio (DTI ratio), the lower the associated risk. As the ratio increases, the level of risk also tends to increase; and a high ratio will have the greatest adverse impact on the recommendation when there are also other high-risk factors present. Published September 4, 2024 284 \u2714 Fannie Mae The composition of the borrower's debt is also taken into consideration. Borrowers whose revolving debt makes up a smaller percentage of their monthly expense have been shown to represent less risk than those whose revolving debt makes up a large percentage of their monthly expenses. Also, borrowers with student loan debt have been shown to represent less risk than those with only revolving debt."}
{"gse": "fannie", "filename": "fannie_part_0", "file_chunk_id": "c780", "chunk_id": "fannie_part_0_c780", "content": "# Housing Expense Ratio\n\nBorrowers with lower housing expense ratios are considered lower risk, while those with higher housing expense ratios are considered higher risk. Research has shown that borrowers whose total monthly expenses are composed primarily of their housing expense may find it more difficult to pay this expense when experiencing an event that would cause financial distress, such as the loss of a job.\n\n## Property Type\n\nAnother important factor that DU considers in the risk analysis is the collateral or property type. DU differentiates the risk based on the number of units, and in some cases the property type (e.g., manufactured home). The level of risk associated with each property type is as follows, starting with those property types representing the least amount of risk: \u2022 one-unit properties; \u2022 condo and co-op properties; \u2022 two-, three-, and four-unit properties; \u2022 manufactured homes."}

As variable income (bonus, overtime, commission, and other income) can differ from year-to-year, borrowers whose total annual income is made up of a higher percentage of variable income represents an increase in risk. Note that other income is based on entry in Form 1003 of \u201cOther\u201d gross monthly income type in current employment, and \u201cOther\u201d in income from other sources."}

The stable and reliable flow of income is a key consideration in mortgage loan underwriting. Individuals who change jobs frequently, but who are nevertheless able to earn consistent and predictable income, are also considered to have a reliable flow of income for qualifying purposes. To demonstrate the likelihood that a consistent level of income will continue to be received for borrowers with less predictable sources of income, the lender must obtain information about prior earnings. Examples of less predictable income sources include commissions, bonuses, substantial amounts of overtime pay, or employment that is subject to time limits, such as contract employees or tradesmen."}

Examples of income of this type include income from hourly workers with fluctuating hours, or income that includes Published September 4, 2024 300 commissions, bonuses, or overtime. History of Receipt: Two or more years of receipt of a particular type of variable income is recommended; however, variable income that has been received for 12 to 24 months may be considered as acceptable income, as long as the borrower's loan application demonstrates that there are positive factors that reasonably offset the shorter income history. For loans with variable income validated by the DU validation service, the required history of receipt may differ from the requirements described above. DU will determine the history required to validate an income type. Frequency of Payment: The lender must determine the frequency of the payment (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually) to arrive at an accurate calculation of the monthly income to be used in the trending analysis (see below). Examples:"}

Note that dividing the bonus received on March 31^{st} by three months produces a much higher, inaccurate monthly average. \u2022 If a borrower is paid overtime on a biweekly basis, the most recent paystub must be analyzed to determine that both the current overtime earnings for the period and the year-to-date overtime earnings are consistent and, if not, why. There are legitimate reasons why these amounts may be inconsistent yet still eligible for use as qualifying income. For example, borrowers may have overtime income that is cyclical (such as transportation employees who operate snow plows in winter, package delivery service workers who work longer hours through the holidays). The lender must investigate the difference between current period overtime and year-to-date earnings and document the analysis before using the income amount in the trending analysis."}

The verbal VOE must be obtained within 10 business days prior to the note date for employment income, and within 120 calendar days prior to the note date for self-employment income. The verbal VOE requirement is intended to help lenders mitigate risk by confirming, as late in the process as possible, that the borrower remains employed as originally disclosed on the loan application. A change in the borrower's employment status could have a significant impact on that borrower's capacity to repay the mortgage loan and must be fully reevaluated. Alternatively, lenders may obtain the verbal VOE after closing, up to the time of loan delivery. If the verbal VOE (or allowable alternative) cannot be obtained prior to delivery, the loan is ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae.

The fundamental exercise, when conducting a self-employment income cash flow analysis, is to determine the amount of income that can be relied on by the borrower in qualifying for their personal mortgage obligation. When underwriting these borrowers, it is important to review business income distributions that have been made or could be made to these borrowers while maintaining the viability of the underlying business. This analysis includes assessing the stability of business income and the ability of the business to continue to generate sufficient income to enable these borrowers to meet their financial obligations."}

The following factors must be analyzed before approving a loan for a self-employed borrower: \u2022 the stability of the borrower's income, \u2022 the location and nature of the borrower's business, \u2022 the demand for the product or service offered by the business, \u2022 the financial strength of the business, and \u2022 the ability of the business to continue generating and distributing sufficient income to enable the borrower to make the payments on the requested loan."}

However, the income of a person who has less than a two-year history of self-employment may be considered, as long as the borrower's most recent signed personal and business federal income tax returns reflect a full year (12 months) of self-employment income from the current business.
