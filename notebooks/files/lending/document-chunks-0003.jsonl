Freddie Mac's public mission is to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the United States housing market. Freddie Mac does this primarily by purchasing residential Mortgages originated by mortgage lenders. In most instances, Freddie Mac packages these Mortgages into mortgage-related securities, which are guaranteed by Freddie Mac and sold in the global capital markets. Freddie Mac also invests in Mortgages and mortgage-related securities. Freddie Mac does not originate Mortgages or lend money directly to consumers. Freddie Mac supports the United States housing market and the overall economy by: \u25a0 Providing America's families with access to mortgage funding at lower rates \u25a0 Helping distressed borrowers keep their homes and avoid foreclosure, and \u25a0 Providing consistent liquidity to the multifamily mortgage market, which includes providing financing for affordable rental housing"}

Freddie Mac does not set a minimum loan amount for purchases and encourages the Seller to make loans of any amount. Mortgages under all purchase programs are purchased by Freddie Mac on a Required Net Yield basis to Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac compensates Seller/Servicers for Servicing Mortgages in an amount equal to the amount of interest payments received on the Mortgages that is over and above the Required Net Yield and authorizes Seller/Servicers to retain such compensation out of such interest payments. Under no circumstance does a Seller/Servicer retain any legal ownership in any portion of the interest due or received under a Mortgage that is owned by Freddie Mac. When a Mortgage is purchased, the Seller must select a Minimum Servicing Spread in an amount that provides adequate Servicing compensation to the Seller/Servicer.

The Security Instrument and other Mortgage documents may be paper or Electronic Records. Introduction \u25a0 Interpreting requirements \u25a0 Complying with eMortgage requirements (a) Introduction Chapter 1402 sets forth Freddie Mac's requirements for eMortgages. Seller/Servicers, custodians and System Providers must comply with these requirements to create, store, sell and service eMortgages. The requirements and specifications in this chapter are based, for the most part, on the requirements of E-SIGN and the UETA. (b) Interpreting requirements set forth in this Chapter 1402 Most types of Mortgages are eligible for delivery to Freddie Mac as eMortgages. Mortgages that are not currently eligible for sale to Freddie Mac as eMortgages, due to additional risks associated with such Mortgages, are set forth in Section 1402.7. Seller/Servicers of eMortgages must comply with all selling and Servicing requirements of the Guide and the Seller/Servicer's other Purchase Documents, as applicable, including the special requirements set forth in this chapter."}

(c) Complying with eMortgage requirements A Seller/Servicer must obtain Freddie Mac's prior written approval, which it may provide in its sole discretion, to sell to and/or service eMortgages for Freddie Mac. This approval is a Purchase Document and may include additional restrictions, requirements, conditions or stipulations relating to the sale and/or Servicing of eMortgages. Seller/Servicers of eMortgages must ensure that they and their System Providers (and if applicable, Correspondents and/or Mortgage Brokers) comply with the requirements specified in this chapter. In addition, contracts between the Seller/Servicer and any System Providers (and if applicable, Correspondents and/or Mortgage Brokers) regarding the provision of eMortgage closing services and eNote Vault System services, must contain certain terms and conditions that may be prescribed by Freddie Mac in its approval or other Purchase Documents."}
